				<p class="upper">So far, performances of laboratory MFCs are still much lower than the ideal performance. There may be several possible reasons. Power generation of an MFC is affected by many factors including microbe type, fuel biomass type and concentration, ionic strength, pH, temperature, and reactor configuration. Effects of reactor configuration and types of microbe used in the MFC have been addressed in Sections 2 and 3. With a given MFC system, the follow-ing operating parameters can be regulated to decrease the polarizations in order to enhance the performance of an MFC.</p>
				<h2 id="_effect">&nbsp;&nbsp; Effect of electrode materials</h2>
				<p class="upper">Using better performing electrode materials can improve the performance of an MFC because different anode materials result in different activation polarization losses. Pt and Pt black electrodes are superior to graphite, graphite felt and carbon-cloth electrodes for both anode and cathode constructions, but their costs are much higher.Schroder et al. (2003) reported that a current of 2-4 mA could be achieved with platinu-mized carbon-cloth anode in an agitated anaerobic cul-ture of E. coliusing a standard glucose medium at 0.55 mmol/L, while no microbially facilitated current flow is observed with the unmodified carbon-cloth with the same operating conditions. Pt also has a higher catalytic activity with regard to oxygen than graphite materials. MFCs with Pt or Pt-coated cathodes yielded  higher power densities than those with graphite or graphite felt cathodes.</p>  
				<h2 id="_ph">&nbsp;&nbsp; pH buffer and electrolyte</h2>
				<p class="upper">If no buffer solution is used in a working MFC, there
				will be an obvious pH difference between the anodic and cathodic chambers, though theoretically there will be no
				pH shift when the reaction rate of protons, electrons and
				oxygen at the cathode equals the production rate of
				protons at the anode. The PEM causes transport barrier
				to the cross membrane diffusion of the protons, and
				proton transport through the membrane is slower than its
				production rate in the anode and its consumption rate in
				the cathode chambers at initial stage of MFC operation
				thus brings a pH difference. However,
				the pH difference increases the driving force of the
				proton diffusion from the anode to the cathode chamber
				and finally a dynamic equilibrium forms. Some protons
				generated with the biodegradation of the organic
				substrate transferred to the cathodic chamber are able
				to react with the dissolved oxygen while some protons
				are accumulated in the anodic chamber when they do
				not transfer across the PEM or salt bridge quickly
				enough to the cathodic chamber. Gil et al. (2003)
				detected a pH difference of 4.1 (9.5 at cathode and 5.4 in
				anode) after 5-hour operations with an initial pH of 7
				without buffering. With the addition of a phosphate
				buffer (pH 7.0), pH shifts at the cathode and anode were
				both less than 0.5 unit and the current output was
				increased about 1 to 2 folds. It was possible that the
				buffer compensated the slow proton transport rate and
				improved the proton availability for the cathodic
				reaction. Jang et al. (2004) supplied an HCl solution
				to the cathode and found that the current output
				increased by about one fold. This again suggests that
				the proton availability to the cathode is a limiting factor
				in electricity generation. Increasing ionic strength by
				adding NaCl to MFCs also improved the power output, possibly due to the
				fact that NaCl enhanced the conductivity of both the
				anolyte and the catholyte.</p>
				<h2 id="_proton">&nbsp;&nbsp; Proton Exchange System</h2>
				<p class="upper">Proton exchange system can affect an MFC system's
				internal resistance and concentration polarization loss
				and they in turn influence the power output of the MFC.
				Nafion (DuPont, Wilmington, Delaware) is most
				popular because of its highly selective permeability of
				protons. Despite attempts by researchers to look for less
				expensive and more durable substitutes, Nafion is still
				the best choice. However, side effect of other cations
				transport is unavoidable during the MFC operation even
				with Nafion. In a batch accumulative system, for
				example, transportation of cation species other than
				protons by Nafion dominates the charge balance
				between the anodic and cathodic chambers because
				concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>,NH<sup>4+</sup>,Ca<sup>2+</sup>,Mg<sup>2+</sup> are much
				higher than the proton concentrations in the anolyte and catholyte. In this sense, Nafion as well as other PEMs used in the MFCs are not a necessarily proton specific membranes but actually cation specific membranes.</p>
				<p class="upper">The ratio of PEM surface area to system volume is
				important for the power output. The PEMsurface area has
				a large impact on maximum power output if the power
				output is below a critical threshold. The MFC internal
				resistance decreaseswith the increase of PEMsurface area
				over a relatively large range.</p>
				<h2 id="_anodic">&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating conditions in the anodic chamber</h2>
				<p class="upper">Fuel type, concentration and feed rate are important
				factors that impact the performance of an MFC. With a
				given microbe or microbial consortium, power density
				varies greatly using different fuels. <b><a style="color:blue" href="table1.html">Table</a></b> shows the
				performances of some MFCs operated using different
				microbes and fuels. Many systems have shown that
				electricity generation is dependent on fuel concentration
				both in batch and continuous-flow modeMFCs. Usually
				a higher fuel concentration yields a higher power output
				in a wide concentration range. Park and Zeikus (2002)
				reported that a higher current level was achieved with
				lactate (fuel) concentration increased until it was in
				excess at 200 mM in a single-compartment MFC inoculated with <i>S. putrefaciens.</i> Moon et al. (2006)
				investigated the effects of fuel concentration on the
				performance of an MFC. Their study also showed that
				the power density was increased with the increase in fuel
				concentration. Gil et al. (2003)
				found that the current increased with a wastewater
				concentration up to 50 mg/L in their MFC. Interestingly,
				the electricity generation in an MFC often peaks at a
				relatively low level of feed rate before heading
				downward. This may be because a high feed rate
				promoted the growth of fermentative bacteria faster than
				those of the electrochemically active bacteria in a mixed
				culture. However, if microbes are growing around the
				electrodes as biofilms, the increased feed rate is unlikely
				to affect the flora. One possible reason is that the high
				feed rate brings in other alternate electron acceptors
				competing with the anode to lower the output.</p>
				<h2 id="_cathodic">&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating conditions in the cathodic chamber</h2>
				<p class="upper">Oxygen is the most commonly used electron acceptor
				in MFCs for the cathodic reaction. Power output of an
				MFC strongly depends on the concentration level of
				electron acceptors. Several studies indicated that DO was a major
				limiting factor when it remained below the air-saturated
				level. Surprisingly, a catholyte sparged with pure oxygen
				that gave 38 mg/L DO did not further increase the power
				output compared to that of the air-saturated water (at
				7.9 mg/L DO). Rate of oxygen diffusion toward the
				anode chamber goes upwith the DO concentration. Thus,
				part of the substrate is consumed directly by the oxygen
				instead of transferring the electrons though the electrode
				and the circuit. Power output is much
				greater using ferricyanide as the electron acceptor in the
				cathodic chamber. So far, reported cases with very high
				power outputs such as 7200 mW/m<sup>2</sup>,4310mW/m
				<sup>2</sup> and 3600 mW/m <sup>2</sup>
				all used ferricyanide in the cathodic
				chamber, while less than 1000 mW/m <sup>2</sup>
				was reported in studies using DO regardless of the electrode
				material. This is likely due to the greatermass transfer rate
				and lower activation energy for the cathodic reaction
				offered by ferricyanide . Using hydrogen
				peroxide solution as the final electron acceptor in the
				cathodic chamber increased power output and current
				density according to Tartakovsky and Guiot (2006).As a
				consequence, aeration is no longer needed for single-compartment MFCs with a cathode that is directly
				exposed to air. Rhoads et al. (2005) measured the cathodic
				polarization curves for oxygen and manganese and found</p>
				<p class="upper">Surely changing operating conditions can improve the
				power output level of the MFCs. However, it is not a
				revolutionary method to upgrade the MFCs from low
				power system to a applicable energy source at the very
				present. The bottleneck lies in the low rate of metabolism
				of the microbes in the MFCs. Even at their fastest growth
				rate microbes are relatively slow
				transformers. The biotransformation rate of substrates
				to electrons has a fixed ceiling which is inherently
				slow. Effort should be focused on how to break the
				inherent metabolic limitation of themicrobes for theMFC
				application. High temperature can accelerate nearly all
				kinds of reactions including chemical and biological ones.
				Use of thermophilic species might benefit for improving
				rates of electron production, however, to the best of our
				knowledge, no such investigation is reported in the
				literature. Therefore this is probably another scope of
				improvement for the MFC technology fromthe laboratory
				research to a real applicable energy source.</p>
